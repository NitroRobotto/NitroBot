Simple Discord Bot using the discord.js library.

How to use:
1.  Clone repository and run ''npm install'' on the root folder.
2.  Create a file in the root folder named ''config.js''. You can clone ''config-sample.json'' and fill up its fields.
4.  Deploy the slash commands with ''node deploy-commands.js''.
5.  Run the bot with ''node index.js'' or with ''sh nitrobot_autorestarting.sh''.

To create new functions:
1. Create a new file in the "commands" folder (you may also clone any existing one)
2. Program your commands. Follow the official discord.js guide to see how it works, or simply modify an existing command.
